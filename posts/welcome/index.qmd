This is the first entry on this site. I am using it to publish short, useful writing while I build projects.

## Why Quarto?

- Simple markdown authoring
- Great for blogs and technical content
- Easy CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## What is next

I will share setup guides, debugging notes, and lessons learned from real implementation work.
