I am Triz.

This blog is where I break down real business and technology problems using the TRIZ 3-step method, then turn them into practical solution concepts.

Most posts are case studies from companies like Starbucks, LEGO, Patagonia, Cadillac, Shake Shack, SolarCity, TD Bank, and Chegg. The goal is simple: make structured innovation thinking concrete and usable.

## What you will find here

- TRIZ case studies on strategy, operations, and innovation
- Contradiction analysis (technical + physical) and IFR thinking
- Practical solution concepts you can adapt to your own context
- Occasional notes about tooling, Quarto, and publishing workflow

## Writing style

- Practical over theoretical
- Framework-driven, with clear steps
- Focused on reusable thinking patterns, not abstract inspiration
